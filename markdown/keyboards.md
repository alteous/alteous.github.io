# Mechanical keyboards

I have collected a total of five mechanical keyboards. The Unicomp is my
favourite but I only use it at home due to the noise!

## Home keyboard

[Unicomp Classic 101](https://www.pckeyboard.com/page/product/UNI041A) with
buckling spring switches, kindly donated to me by Bryan Law-Smith.

## Work keyboard

Filco Majestouch-2 TKL with Cherry MX Blue switches and

## Other keyboards

* DAS keyboard with Cherry MX Brown switches, also donated to me by Bryan Law-Smith.
* KB Paradise V80TKL Vintage with Cherry MX Clear switches.
* Cooler Master Masterkeys S with Cherry MX Green switches.

## Layout

All but the DAS keyboard have the US/ANSI key layout. I prefer this to the UK
layout since the syntax of programming languages seem to be designed with this
layout in mind. Having lived in the US for a year I got used to this layout too.
I map the dollar sign to sterling to get the Â£ symbol:

`xmodmap -e 'keysym dollar = sterling'`
