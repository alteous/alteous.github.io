# Aviation

I am training to earn a private pilot's licence. Currently I am training with
[Mid Anglia School of Flying](http://masfcambridge.com/), flying their two Piper
PA28-161 aeroplanes G-JASE and G-BFWB.

Taxying G-JASE at Cambridge airport.

## Bucket list

* Fly a fast complex aircraft like the Piper Arrow III or Mooney Rocket.
* Fly around Europe, stopping off at Innsbruck.
* Fly at night.
* Earn an IFR rating so I can fly in the clouds.
