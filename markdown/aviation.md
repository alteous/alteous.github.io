# Aviation

From the first flight I experienced as a child, I've been fascinated by planes.
My childhood dream was to be a pilot. In 2018, I began training
at [MASF](http://masfcambridge.com/) flying their Piper PA28-161 aeroplanes.
I earned a private pilot's licence at the end of 2021. I'm very thankful to have
this priviledge and I consider my childhood dream to have been satisfied.

Recently I took my parents for a local flight from Cambridge airport to the
Wash and back.

I'm particularly fond of flying above the clouds. It's like experiencing a
whole other world.

In 2022 I added a night rating to my licence. Flying at night is pretty but
also scary when the single engine decides to make a strange noise!
