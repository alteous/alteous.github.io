# Rabbits

I live with two house rabbits: Shadow (left) and Socks.

I adopted Socks and Shadow two years ago from Pets at Home in Loughton. A bond with a prey
animal is particularly special as it requires one to earn the animal's trust. It took roughly
six months before Shadow and Socks were comfortable with me.

Rabbits have a surprising amount of personality and intelligence. Socks is known for being friendly but skittish.
He loves his treats and will do tricks for them such as 'stand up' and 'twirl'.

Shadow, on the other hand, is reserved but more inquisitive than Socks. He likes to be
stroked but only on his terms. Few people appreciate Shadow because he's unsociable with
new people, so few believe me when I say he is the more affectionate of the pair.
