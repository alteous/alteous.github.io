# Music

I play the guitar. Nowadays I enjoy playing blues, particularly Stevie Ray
Vaughan. I'd like to learn violin one day and play [old time string band](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vRXJzCdrEDs&ab_channel=TommyStanton)
tunes.

I'm currently perfecting [Cliffs of Dover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiRn3Zlw3Rw) by Eric Johnson on the electric guitar and playing AC/DC songs in the meantime. [Dave Cartwright](http://www.dave145s.co.uk) is my teacher.

Some of my favourite tunes to play are [Scuttle Buttin'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r56RRl7-vU) and [Rude Mood](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2q0NXIL6m0) by Stevie Ray Vaughan and [Summer Song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NJ_nzOckOQ) by Joe Satriani.

A few years ago I was more into fingerstyle guitar.
I learned to play Rhett Butler's awesome arrangement of
[Cliffs of Dover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl-3RTyFMrQ&ab_channel=RhettButler)
and Larry Pattis' beautiful arrangement of [Waltzing Matilda](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yE3uwQsV7I&ab_channel=LarryPattis).
