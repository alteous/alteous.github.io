# Hair care guide

## Prescription

To care for fine, dry hair types:

* Use a [gentle shampoo and conditioner](https://www.amazon.co.uk/ArtNaturals-Organic-Moroccan-Argan-Oil-Shampoo/dp/B014RU0SG4): alcohol and sulfates dry it out.
* Moisture is important, so leave conditioner in for at least five minutes.
* Brush your hair twice a day with a [bamboo brush](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Neverland-Detangling-Anti-Static-Cushioned-Hairbrush/dp/B072M6QXSN), preferably when it's dry.
* Brush in stages beginning near the ends and ending at the crown.
* Avoid using dryers and straighteners as they dry and damage your hair.
* Avoid tight and frequent hair ties and they will damage your hair.
* Shampoo no more than twice a week.

## Tips

* Sleep on a [satin pillow case](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Wrighteu-Pillowcases-Pillow-Hidden-Polyester/dp/B07GNKCRNN) to reduce knots and tangles.
* Distribute a _single drop_ of [pure Argan oil](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00DUCOZWY) to weigh down frizzy hair.
* Use a T-shirt instead of a towel when pat drying to avoid gathering lint.
