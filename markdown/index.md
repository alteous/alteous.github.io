## Recommendations

* Use [duckduckgo.com](https://duckduckgo.com) to browse the web in peace.
* Use [`rpl`](https://linux.die.net/man/1/rpl) to find and replace strings in files. It's friendlier than `sed`.
* Use [`redshift`](http://jonls.dk/redshift/) to allow your eyes adjust to using the computer during the evening.
* Use the [Tango colour palette](https://bit.ly/2GrhWjl) (try `(load-theme 'tango-dark)` in emacs).
* [Remove blinking cursors](http://www.jurta.org/en/prog/noblink) to save your sanity.
* [Enable sticky keys](https://superuser.com/questions/410657/enabling-sticky-keys-under-xorg-awesome-desktop-manager) for comfort and to avoid 'emacs pinky'.
* If, like me, you have long dry hair: read my [hair care guide](hair.html).
* Use a [trackball mouse](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Logitech-M570-Wireless-Trackball-Mouse/dp/B07877N96T) for comfort and space efficiency.

## Source

The source code for this website is licensed under the MIT licence. The HTML pages
are generated from Markdown using a quick-and-dirty Python script. The source code
is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/alteous/website) for you to observe
with horror!

I've been asked a few times why I wrote my own site generator rather than use
an existing static site generator. There are two reasons: (1) it's an exercise for
me to learn some Python; (2) I wanted a minimalistic website.
